* Why types?

- Gives an abstraction and prevent accidentally mixing up types.
- Hides low-level details of implementation.
- Haskell has *strong* *static* and *inferred* type system.
- *Stong* means that haskell will not automatically cast the type in any situation.
- Type check is done during compiling so hardly no type error during runtime.
